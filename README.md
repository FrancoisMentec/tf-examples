# Summary

## Linear regression with the Iris flower dataset.

* There are two versions: `iris_linreg_np.py` is written in pure NumPy, while `iris_linreg_tf.py` uses TensorFlow.

## Logistic regression for MNIST handwritten digit classification.

## Convolutional neural network for MNIST handwritten digit classification.

* There are two versions: `mnist_cnn.py` is a single file, while `mnist_cnn_model.py`, `mnist_cnn_train.py`, and `mnist_cnn_test` demonstrate a more canonical way to organize files for such projects.

## Variational autoencoder for MNIST.

* This is a simplified version of the code from https://jmetzen.github.io/2015-11-27/vae.html.
